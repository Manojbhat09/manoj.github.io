I am a graduate research student in at Carnegie Mellon University. I work with Dr. Ding Zhao and Dr. Raj Rajkumar on research areas at the intersection of Robotics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I has always looked into solving real world problems using my skills in Programming, M.L, D.L, IoT and ROS to obtain fruitful solutions.

During my undergraduate degree in MIT Manipal, I was part of building India's first 4 seater solar electric vehicle for a period of 2 years in MIT Manipal. 
I also worked as a Research Engineer in a startup Ashva Electronic Motorsports where I worked on Self-balacing hardware with matlab modeling analytics. And reinforcement Learning software for control.
I later worked in Amazon Tranporation Analytics as a Business Intelligence engineer. 

I spent my summer quarter in Robert Bosch Research and Development Center in the Core Technology as a Computer Vision Research engineer. My objectives and tasks in the internship included developing modelling and applying 3D vision Deep learning techniques, designing a Web App for visualizing the results, building the cloud infrastructure for deploying the application and setting up the database and  working on Machine Leaning methods to give pruned predictions. I looked into how to build real-time cloud AWS-S3 systems for Computer Vision applications.

I am a self-motivated and passionate engineering student looking to contribute to technological growth and development.
