Manoj is a graduate research student in at Carnegie Mellon University. He works with Dr. Ding Zhao and Dr. Raj Rajkumar on research areas at the intersection of Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

He has always looked into solving real world problems using his skills in Programming, M.L, IoT and ROS to obtain fruitful robotics solutions.

During he undergraduate degree in MIT Manipal (ECE), he was part of building India's first 4 seater solar electric vehicle for a period of 2 years in MIT Manipal. 
He later worked in Amazon Tranporation Analytics as a Business Intelligence engineer. 

He spent his summer quarter in Robert Bosch Research and development Center. in the Core Technology as a Computer Vision Research engineer. His objectives and tasks in the internship included developing modelling and applying 3D vision Deep learning techniques, designing a Web App for visualizing the results, building the cloud infrastructure for deploying the application and setting up the database and  working on Machine Leaning methods to give pruned predictions. He looked into how to build real-time cloud AWS-S3 systems for Computer Vision applications.

Manoj tries to make robots see, recognize, think and understand.
Check out his published work, Projects and CV.
